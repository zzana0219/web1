    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>

    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
       is an information system where documents and other web resources
        are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
         (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
         which may be interlinked by hypertext,
         and are accessible over the Internet.
         The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext
         Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a
         software application called a web browser and are published
         by a software application called a web server.
